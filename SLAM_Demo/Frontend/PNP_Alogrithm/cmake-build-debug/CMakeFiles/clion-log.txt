CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:5 (target_link_libraries):
  Cannot specify link libraries for target "P3PSolve" which is not built by
  this project.

  CMake does not support this but it used to work accidentally and is being
  allowed for compatibility.

  Policy CMP0016 is not set: target_link_libraries() reports error if its
  only argument is not a target.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0016" for
  policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and
  suppress this warning.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
